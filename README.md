# <First-Challenge>

## Description

This website was edited in order to follow accessibility standards and optimized for search engines. The existing HTML and CSS code alike have been modified to make the code more readable and follow sequential order, as well as cut back on the amount of unnecessary classes within the code(a few different classes had the same CSS code, so the copies were deleted, and the HTML code now reflects the class changes). I also added a title to the webpage, and added alt text to all of the images present on the webpage. Lastly, all of the div elements were turned into semantical HTML elements.
